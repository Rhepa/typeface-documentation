                <h2>Inspiration</h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by cute blocky fonts and also by the mermaid/unicorn color palette. However, I didn't want to make it too pastel so in my final work made, I chose a bit more saturated colors. I didn't want to make complicated font design, since I personally prefer more simple, and readable fonts.

                    Here are some rough designs that I am aiming to create in CSS. I was debating wether to make the witdh of the letter thin, or thick. I felt like making the width thin is common in fonts, so I decided to go maybe for a thick width.

                <p>
                    This is first part of the font in CSS. Overall, I like the way it came out but it feels a bit too plain. I gave a bit of a geometric form to it to have that sort of "futuristic" look to it. However, I am not completely satisfied with so therefore I decided to refine, and edit it more.
